# reMINDer
reMINDer is a non-intrusive daily reminder app that leverages spaced repetition learning techniques. You enter a bunch of quotes, and you will get a periodic e-mail (the non-intrusive part) of randomly selected quotes. Quotes that are sent recently or have been sent more times overall will be sent less frequently in the future (the spaced repetition part).

I built this app because I couldn't find another app that did something similar, and it is useful if you can't always find time to dedicate to focused learning via systems like Anki.

reMINDer is built with Vue, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap.

It is currently under constant development.
